## ðŸ“¢ Notice Regarding Guides, Contributions, and Sharing

I kindly ask that you **do not copy or redistribute any parts of my guide and software** without explicit permission.<br/>
In the past, sections of my work have been used without proper credit and claimed as their work.<br/>
Incorrect parts have been added to other guides and resulted in additional effort on my part.<br/>
This resulted in me being contacted for support related to these guides which had errors.<br/>
I hope you do understand that I dont like to spend extra time to fix other faults :).<br/>
<br/>
**However, feel free to share the guide with others as long as proper credit is given!**<br/>
The more users can benefit from it, the happier I get ;)<br/>
<br/>
I invite everyone to share and collaborate to make this the "go-to" place for X3-Series improvements.
If you have suggestions or improvements, I warmly invite you to **submit your contributions directly to me**.<br/>
I will gladly consider integrating them to improve the guide and firmwares for everyone.<br/>
This not only improves the usability for everyone, but also helps to ensure accuracy and reduces unnecessary support issues.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for respecting this request and for helping to foster a supportive and fair community.<br/>
<br/><br/>
